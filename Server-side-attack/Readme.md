## Web Security Homework #3

> *This file is indicating the **additional** files and files of **modification**.  
> For detailed instructions, please refer to the README file inside each part.

For Task 1, there is an additional file that put outside the root of the website, which is "/task-files/task1-flag.txt".  

For Task 2 and 3, there are two additional python files for launching attacks through POST methods, which are "/task-files/task2.py" and "/task-files/task3.py".

For Task 4, we modified the source file to patch, which is "/websec-lab-notes/src/app.js".

For Task 5, we directly launch the attack and therefore no file is changed or added.

For Task 6 and 7, we modified the source file to patch, which is "/websec-lab-jsonbin/jsonbin/lib/routes/api.js".
